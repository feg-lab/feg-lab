I started as an Assoc. Professor at Nord in 2024. I postdoc'd previously with Craig Primmer at the University of Helsinki (2018-2023), as a MSCA postdoc with Dylan Fraser and Alisa Piekny at Concordia University (Montreal, 2023-2024) and Frederic Guillaume (U Helsinki), as well as with Felicity Jones at the Max Planck Institute (Tuebingen, 2014-2018). I have a PhD in forest genomics from Laval University (Quebec City, 2008-2014) with John MacKay and Christian Landry.
