# Molecular basis of adaptive traits and evolutionary change

We are a group of scientists at Nord University who want to understand the mechanisms that create and maintain phenotypic diversity from the molecular to the species level. We combine the study of natural populations with common-garden experiments, functional genomics tools and population genomic approaches. Our favourite organisms are salmonids due to their amazing diversity in adaptions and life history traits.
