# Molecular basis of adaptive traits and evolutionary change

We are a group of scientists at Nord University who want to understand the genetic mechanisms that create and maintain phenotypic diversity from the molecular to the species level. We work towards discovering the genotype-to-phenotype map for adaptive traits and to predict how adaptation to future conditions might be constrained by the genetic architecture of traits.

## Highlights

We study the molecular mechanisms of variation in life history traits. We combine the study of natural populations with common-garden experiments, functional genomics tools and population genomic approaches. Our favourite organisms are salmonids due to their amazing diversity in adaptions and life history strategies.

We mainly work on Atlantic salmon, but we've also studied diverse fishes, plants, and fungi.
