I'm an Assoc Professor at Nord from 2024 onwards. Previously I have worked as  a postdoc with Craig Primmer at the University of Helsinki, as a MSCA postdoc with Dylan Fraser and Alisa Piekny at Concordia University (Montreal) and Frederic Guillaume (U Helsinki), as well as Felicity Jones at the Max Planck Institute (Tuebingen). I have a PhD in forest genomics from Laval University (Quebec City) with John MacKay and Christian Landry.
